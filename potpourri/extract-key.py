Extract a private key from rpkid's database.

This is a debugging tool.  rpkid goes to some trouble not to expose
private keys, which is correct for normal operation, but for debugging
it is occasionally useful to be able to extract the private key from
MySQL.  This script is just a convenience, it doesn't enable anything
that couldn't be done via the mysql command line tool.

While we're at this we also extract the corresponding certificate.
