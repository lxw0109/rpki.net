"""
Fix problems in asns.csv generated from RIPE's database.

RIPE's database contains inconsistancies, overlaps, and format errors
that make it impossible to feed the output of ripe-to-csv.awk directly
into testbed-rootcert.py without OpenSSL rejecting the resulting
root.conf.  This script takes a brute force approach to fixing this:
it converts all ASNs to range form, runs the resulting file through
the unix sort program to put the data into canonical order, then reads
it back, merging overlaps, and writing the result in a form acceptable
to testbed-rootcert.py.

Since we're doing all this anyway, the script also merges adjacent
blocks.

Ordinarily, it would be dangerous to have the same program act as both
the source and sink of a pipeline, particularly for such a large data
set, as the chance of deadlock would approach 100%, but in this case
we know that the sort program must consume and buffer (somehow) all of
its input before writing a single line of output, so a single script
can safely act as a filter both before and after sort.
