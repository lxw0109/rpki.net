Pull RFC 3779 resources from a cert, attempt to mine routeviews (via
DNS, using the dnspython toolkit) for what the ROAs might look like
for the addresses found in the cert.

This doesn't handle IPv6, because neither, apparently, does the
routeviews DNS interface.  Oh well.

NB: this is wild-assed guessing at best.  Even if the routeviews data
were signed, which it is not, you have no particular reason to believe
it.  Do not use output of this script production.  Sanity check.
Beware of dog.  If you issue ROAs using this script and your wallpaper
peels, your cat explodes, or your children turn blue, it's your own
fault for using this script.  You have been warned.
