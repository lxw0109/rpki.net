# Parse a WHOIS research dump and write out (just) the RPKI-relevant
# fields in myrpki-format CSV syntax.
#
# Unfortunately, unlike the ARIN and APNIC databases, the RIPE database
# doesn't really have any useful concept of an organizational handle.
# More precisely, while it has handles out the wazoo, none of them are
# useful as a reliable grouping mechanism for tracking which set of
# resources are held by a particular organization.  So, instead of being
# able to track all of an organization's resources with a single handle
# as we can in the ARIN and APNIC databases, the best we can do with the
# RIPE database is to track individual resources, each with its own
# resource handle.  Well, for prefixes -- ASN entries behave more like
# in the ARIN and APNIC databases.
#
# This is an AWK script rather than a Python script because it is a
# fairly simple stream parser that has to process a ridiculous amount
# of text.  AWK turns out to be significantly faster for this.
#
# NB: The input data for this script is publicly available via FTP, but
# you'll have to fetch the data from RIPE yourself, and be sure to see
# the terms and conditions referenced by the data file header comments.
