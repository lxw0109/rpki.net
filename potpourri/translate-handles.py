"""
Translate handles from the ones provided in a database dump into the
ones we use in our testbed.  This has been broken out into a separate
program for two reasons:

- Conversion of some of the RIR data is a very slow process, and it's
  both annoying and unnecessary to run it every time we add a new
  participant to the testbed.

- This handle translation business now has fingers into half a dozen
  scripts, so it needs refactoring in any case, either as a common
  library function or as a separate script.

This program takes a list of .CSV files on its command line, and
rewrites them as needed after performing the translation.
