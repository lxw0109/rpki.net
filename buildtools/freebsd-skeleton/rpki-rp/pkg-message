You may want to customize /usr/local/etc/rcynic.conf.  If you did not
install your own trust anchors, a default set of SAMPLE trust anchors
may have been installed for you, but you, the relying party, are the
only one who can decide whether you trust those anchors.  rcynic will
not do anything useful without good trust anchors.

rcynic-cron has been configured to run hourly, at a randomly selected
minute, to spread load on the global RPKI repository servers.  Please
do NOT adjust this to run on the hour.  In particular please do NOT
adjust this to run at midnight UTC.
