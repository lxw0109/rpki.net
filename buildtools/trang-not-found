# This script formerly used absolute paths for all (ie, both) programs
# it called, as any sane script should, but it met defeat at the hands
# of the penguinistas, who can't even agree on whether to keep the
# "test" program in /bin or /usr/bin, thus creating a second-order
# problem of finding the test program to test for the existence of the
# program we really wanted to run.  Enough already.
#
# So: If this script breaks because it can't find the "cat" or "touch"
# programs on your path, fix your path.

WARNING:

trang XML schema converter not found on your system.  If you haven't
modified any of the RelaxNG source files, you can ignore this, as it's
probably a spurious warning caused by something stomping file
modification times in the source repository or your local build tree.

If you have modified the RelaxNG sources, you need to install trang
(see installation manual).

Suppressing this warning for file: $2
