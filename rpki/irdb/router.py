Django-style "Database router".

For most programs, you don't need this.  Django's normal mode of
behavior is to use a single SQL database for the IRDB, which is
normally what we want.  For certain test scenarios, however, it's
useful to be able to use the same Django ORM models and managers with
multiple databases without having to complicate the interface by
passing database names everywhere.  Using a database router
accomplishes this.
