RPKI Toolkit

See:

- The primary documentation at http://trac.rpki.net/ (recommended),

- The PDF manual in doc/manual.pdf, or

- The flat text pages doc/doc.RPKI.RP.rpki-rtr

For the impatient: installation instructions are in
doc/doc.RPKI.Installation, but be warned that you'll have to read more
of the manual to configure the software after you've installed it.
