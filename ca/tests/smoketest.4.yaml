# This is a test of what happens when certificates go missing in
# action, IRDB data expires, etc.  Expected result:
#
# - RIR, R0, and Alice get certs
# - Bob gets no cert at all
# - RO and Alice have short-lived certs, which go away
# - Test ends with only RIR having a cert
#
# If run on a very slow machine, the 60 second expiration may have
# already passed by the time everything is up and running, in which
# case nobody but RIR will ever get any certs.
#
# The extra cycles with no sleep are deliberate, at one point we had a
# cycle where parent would issue a cert that had already expired,
# which led to a tight loop of revocation and reissuance every cycle;
# we're checking to make sure that doesn't happen anymore, although
# things should never get to that point because list_response should
# discourage the child from ever asking for a cert in the first place.
