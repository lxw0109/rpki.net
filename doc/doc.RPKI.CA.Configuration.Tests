****** smoketest.yaml ******

smoketest test description file is named smoketest.yaml by default. Run
smoketest with "-y filename" to change it. The YAML file contains multiple YAML
"documents". The first document describes the initial test layout and resource
allocations, subsequent documents describe modifications to the initial
allocations and other parameters. Resources listed in the initial layout are
aggregated automatically, so that a node in the resource hierarchy
automatically receives the resources it needs to issue whatever its children
are listed as holding. Actions in the subsequent documents are modifications to
the current resource set, modifications to validity dates or other non-resource
parameters, or special commands like "sleep".

Here's an example of current usage:

      name:           Alice
      valid_for:      2d
      sia_base:       "rsync://alice.example/rpki/"
      kids:
        - name: Bob
       kids:
         - name: Carol
           ipv4: 192.0.2.1-192.0.2.33
           asn:  64533
      ---
      - name: Carol
        valid_add:   10
      ---
      - name: Carol
        add_as: 33
        valid_add:   2d
      ---
      - name: Carol
        valid_sub:   2d
      ---
      - name: Carol
        valid_for:   10d

This specifies an initial layout consisting of an RPKI engine named "Alice",
with one child "Bob", which in turn has one child "Carol". Carol has a set of
assigned resources, and all resources in the system are initially set to be
valid for two days from the time at which the test is started. The first
subsequent document adds ten seconds to the validity interval for Carol's
resources and makes no other modifications. The second subsequent document
grants Carol additional resources and adds another two days to the validity
interval for Carol's resources. The next document subtracts two days from the
validity interval for Carol's resources. The final document sets the validity
interval for Carol's resources to ten days.

Operators in subsequent (update) documents:

add_as::

     Add ASN resources.

add_v4::

     Add IPv4 resources.

add_v6::

     Add IPv6 resources.

sub_as::

     Subtract ASN resources.

sub_v4::

     Subtract IPv4 resources.

sub_v6::

     Subtract IPv6 resources.

valid_until::

     Set an absolute expiration date.

valid_for::

     Set a relative expiration date.

valid_add::

     Add to validity interval.

valid_sub::

     Subtract from validity interval.

sleep [interval]::

     Sleep for specified interval, or until smoketest receives a SIGALRM
     signal.

shell cmd...::

     Pass rest of line verbatim to /bin/sh and block until the shell
     returns.

Absolute timestamps should be in the form shown (UTC timestamp format as used
in XML).

Intervals (valid_add, valid_sub, valid_for, sleep) are either integers, in
which case they're interpreted as seconds, or are a string of the form "wD xH
yM zS" where w, x, y, and z are integers and D, H, M, and S indicate days,
hours, minutes, and seconds. In the latter case all of the fields are optional,
but at least one must be specified. For example, "3D4H" means "three days plus
four hours".
