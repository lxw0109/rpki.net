****** Apache Configuration ******

This page documents how to configure Apache to server the web portal
application.

During the software install process, /usr/local/etc/rpki/apache.conf is
created, which needs to be included from the apache configuration inside of a
VirtualHost section.

Note that the web portal application requires TLS to be enabled for the
VirtualHost it is configured in, otherwise it will fail to operate.

***** Requirements *****

* Apache 2.2 or later
* mod_ssl
* mod_wsgi 3 or later

***** Debian & Ubuntu *****

First, you need to install apache and enable SSL. Run the following commands in
a shell as root:

  apt-get install apache2 libapache2-mod-wsgi
  a2enmod ssl
  a2ensite default-ssl

Edit /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/default-ssl and place the following line inside
the <VirtualHost> section:

  Include /usr/local/etc/rpki/apache.conf

Now restart apache:

  service apache2 restart

***** FreeBSD *****

Now configure apache, using /usr/local/etc/rpki/apache.conf, e.g.

  $ cp apache.conf /usr/local/etc/apache22/Includes/rpki.conf

Restart apache

  $ apachectl restart

***** Running the web portal as a different user (optional) *****

By default, the web portal is run in embedded mode in mod_wsgi, which means it
runs inside the apache process. However, you can make the web portal run in
daemon mode as a different user using mod_wsgi.

  $ ./configure --enable-wsgi-daemon-mode[=user[:group]]

Where user is the optional user to run the web portal as, and group is the
optional group to run the web portal as. If user is not specified, it will run
in a separate process but the same user as apache is configured to run.

Note that when run in daemon mode, a unix domain socket will be created in the
same directory as the apache log files. If the user you have specified to run
the web portal as does not have permission to read a file in that directory,
the web interface will return a 500 Internal Server Error and you will see a
permission denied error in your apache logs. The solution to this is to use the
WSGISocketPrefix apache configuration directive to specify an alternative
location, such as:

  WSGISocketPrefix /var/run/wsgi

Note that this directive must not be placed inside of the VirtualHost section.
It must be located at the global scope.

see http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/wiki/
ConfigurationDirectives#WSGISocketPrefix for more information.

***** Verify the Web Portal is Working *****

Navigate to https://YOURHOST/rpki/ and you should see the login page for the
web portal.

Enter the superuser and password in login form (see doc/RPKI/CA/UI/GUI/
UserModel if you haven't yet created a superuser). If you've only done the
above bootstrap, there will only be a single handle to manage, so the GUI will
automatically bring you to the dashboard for that handle.
