****** Installation Using Debian Packages on Debian and Ubuntu Systems ******

Precompiled binary packages for Ubuntu 12.04 LTS ("Precise Pangolin") and
Debian 7 ("Wheezy") are available from download.rpki.net using the Debian
Advanced Package Tools (APT). To use these, you need to configure APT on your
machine to know about our APT repository, but once you've done this you should
be able to install and update these packages like any other precompiled
package.

***** Initial APT Setup *****

You should only need to perform these steps once for any particular machine.

* Add the GPG public key for this repository (optional, but APT will whine
  unless you do this):

    wget -q -O - http://download.rpki.net/APT/apt-gpg-key.asc | sudo apt-key
    add -

* Configure APT to use this repository (for Ubuntu Trusty systems):

    sudo wget -q -O /etc/apt/sources.list.d/rpki.list http://download.rpki.net/
    APT/rpki.trusty.list

* Configure APT to use this repository (for Ubuntu Precise systems):

    sudo wget -q -O /etc/apt/sources.list.d/rpki.list http://download.rpki.net/
    APT/rpki.precise.list

* Configure APT to use this repository (for Debian Wheezy systems):

    sudo wget -q -O /etc/apt/sources.list.d/rpki.list http://download.rpki.net/
    APT/rpki.wheezy.list

***** Installation Using APT Tools *****

These instructions assume that you're using apt-get. Other APT tools such as
aptitude should also work.

* Update available packages:

    sudo apt-get update

* Install the software:

    sudo apt-get install rpki-rp rpki-ca

* Customize the default rpki.conf for your environment as necessary. In
  particular, you want to change handle and rpkid_server_host. There are
  obsessively detailed instructions.

    sudo emacs /etc/rpki.conf

     Again, you want to change handle and rpkid_server_host at the
     minimum.

* If you changed anything in rpki.conf, you should restart the RPKI CA service:

    sudo service rpki-ca restart

***** Upgrading *****

Once you've performed the steps above you should be able to upgrade to newer
version of the code using the normal APT upgrade process, eg:

  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get upgrade

Or, if you only want to update the RPKI tools:

  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get upgrade rpki-ca rpki-rp
