****** RPKI Tools Manual ******

This collection of tools implements both the production (CA) and relying party
(RP) sides of an RPKI environment.

The Subversion repository for the entire project is available for (read-only)
anonymous access at http://subvert-rpki.hactrn.net/.

If you just want to browse the code you might find the Trac source code browser
interface more convenient.

***** Download and Install *****

Full source code is available, as are binary packages for a few platforms.

See the installation instructions for how to download the code and install it
once you've downloaded it.

***** Relying Party Tools *****

If you operate routers and want to use RPKI data to help secure them, you
should look at the relying party tools.

***** CA Tools *****

If you control RPKI resources and need an engine let you request certificates,
issue ROAs, or issue certificates to other entities, you should look at the CA
tools.
