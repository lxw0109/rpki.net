This directory contains PDF and flat text translations of the
documentation for the RPKI toolkit.  The primary documentation source
is the web site http://trac.rpki.net/, the files here are best-effort
attempts at mechanical translation of that content into other formats.

The doc.* files are flat text translated by html2text.

manual.pdf is a translation by htmldoc.

Neither translation is perfect, something is always lost.  When in
doubt, consult the web site if you can.

In theory, the contents of this directory are kept up to date with
respect to the web site by a cron job.  If you happen notice that the
contents here seem to be lagging the web site by more than a few
hours, please report it.
