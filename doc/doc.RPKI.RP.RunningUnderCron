****** Running relying party tools under cron ******

rcynic is the primary relying party tool, and it's designed to run under the
cron daemon. Consequently, most of the other tools are also designed to run
under the cron daemon, so that they can make use of rcynic's output immediately
after rcynic finishes a validation run.

rcynic-cron runs the basic set of relying party tools (rcynic, rcynic-html, and
rpki-rtr cronjob); if this suffices for your purposes, you don't need to do
anything else. This section is a discussion of alternative approaches.

Which tools you want to run depends on how you intend to use the relying party
tools. Here we assume a typical case in which you want to gather and validate
RPKI data and feed the results to routers using the rpki-rtr protocol. We also
assume that everything has been installed in the default locations.

The exact sequence for invoking rcynic itself varies depending both on whether
you're using a chroot jail or not and on the platform on which you're running
rcynic, as the chroot utilities on different platforms behave slightly
differently. Using a chroot jail used to be the default for rcynic, but it
turned out that many users found the setup involved to be too complex.

If you're not using rcynic-cron, it's probably simplest to generate a short
shell script which calls the tools you want in the correct order, so that's
what we show here.

Once you've written this script, install it in your crontab, running at some
appropriate interval: perhaps hourly, or perhaps every six hours, depending on
your needs. You should run it at least once per day, and probably should not
run it more frequently than once per hour unless you really know what you are
doing. Please do NOT just arrange for the script to run on the hour, instead
pick some random minute value within the hour as the start time for your
script, to help spread the load on the repository servers.

On FreeBSD or MacOSX, this script might look like this:

  #!/bin/sh -
  /usr/sbin/chroot -u rcynic -g rcynic /var/rcynic /bin/rcynic -c /etc/
  rcynic.conf || exit
  /var/rcynic/bin/rcynic-html /var/rcynic/data/rcynic.xml /usr/local/www/data/
  rcynic
  /usr/bin/su -m rcynic -c '/usr/local/bin/rpki-rtr cronjob /var/rcynic/data/
  authenticated /var/rcynic/rpki-rtr'

This assumes that you have done

  mkdir /var/rcynic/rpki-rtr
  chown rcynic /var/rcynic/rpki-rtr

On GNU/Linux systems, the script might look like this if you use the chrootuid
program:

  #!/bin/sh -
  /usr/bin/chrootuid /var/rcynic rcynic /bin/rcynic -c /etc/rcynic.conf || exit
  /var/rcynic/bin/rcynic-html /var/rcynic/data/rcynic.xml /var/www/rcynic
  /usr/bin/su -m rcynic -c '/usr/local/bin/rpki-rtr cronjob /var/rcynic/data/
  authenticated /var/rcynic/rpki-rtr'

If you use the chroot program instead of chrootuid, change the line that
invokes rcynic to:

  /usr/sbin/chroot --userspec rcynic:rcynic /var/rcynic /bin/rcynic -c /etc/
  rcynic.conf || exit
