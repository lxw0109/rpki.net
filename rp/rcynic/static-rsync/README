Hack to build a static rsync binary suitable for use in a chroot jail.

The default configuration is for gcc, since that's the most widely
used compiler on the platforms we use.  I've provided hooks intended
to make it simple to support other compilers just by overriding make
variables on the command line: if you need to do something more
drastic than this to get your compiler working, please tell me.

If your platform doesn't support static binaries at all, you're on
your own (and should whine at your OS vendor, as this is nuts).

We try to stick with rsync release code, but apply security patches
when necessary.
