# Generate a trust anchor locator (TAL) given the rsync URI for a

# Usage: make-tal.sh uri [local_copy_of_certificate]
#
# The optional second parameter is the name of a local copy of the
# certificate to be checked against the copy retrieved from the URI;
# if present, this should be a local X.509 file in DER format.
